I'll check the updated project to verify if the English explanation generation has been removed as recommended.Based on my review of the updated project, the changes were **partially implemented** but **not complete**. Here's what I found:

## ✅ **What was done correctly:**

1. **In `server/services/gemini.ts`**:
   - The `generateQuestionExplanation` function has been REMOVED ✓
   - The `FormattedQuestion` interface was updated to remove the `explanation` field ✓
   - Now only contains the `formatQuestionText` function

2. **In `replit.md`**:
   - Documentation updated to mention "Eliminated English explanations to reduce API costs by ~33%" ✓

## ❌ **What still needs to be fixed:**

1. **In `server/routes.ts`**:
   - Still imports `generateQuestionExplanation` from gemini.ts (this will cause an error!)
   - Still tries to call `generateQuestionExplanation` in the submit answer route
   - Still includes `explanation` in the feedback response

## **This will cause a runtime error!**

The current state will crash when someone submits an answer because `routes.ts` is trying to import and use a function that no longer exists.

## **Remaining steps for Replit AI Agent:**

**In `server/routes.ts`:**

1. **Update the import line** from:
   ```typescript
   import { formatQuestionText, generateQuestionExplanation } from "./services/gemini";
   ```
   To:
   ```typescript
   import { formatQuestionText } from "./services/gemini";
   ```

2. **Remove the English explanation generation code** (around line 145-151):
   ```typescript
   // Remove this entire block:
   let explanation = question.explanation;
   if (!explanation) {
     explanation = await generateQuestionExplanation(
       question.questionText, 
       question.correctAnswer
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Update the feedback response** to remove `explanation`:
   ```typescript
   const feedback = {
     isCorrect,
     correctAnswer: question.correctAnswer,
     arabicExplanation,
     selectedAnswer: submission.selectedAnswer,
   };
   ```

Once these changes are made, the app will work correctly with only Arabic explanations, saving ~33% on Gemini API costs!
