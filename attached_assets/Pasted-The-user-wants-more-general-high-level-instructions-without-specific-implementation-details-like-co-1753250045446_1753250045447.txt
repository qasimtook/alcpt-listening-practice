The user wants more general, high-level instructions without specific implementation details like column names, file paths, or code snippets. They want a conceptual approach that the Replit agent can interpret and implement in its own way.

Looking at your ALCPT application, here's the recommended optimization approach:

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. **Audio caching** - Highest cost savings
2. **AI-generated content caching** - Second highest cost savings  
3. **Skip audio for non-listening questions** - Quick performance win

## Step 1: Implement Audio Caching

**Goal:** Generate audio only once per question and reuse it

**Instructions:**
- Modify the database to track whether audio has been generated for each question
- Create a permanent storage system for audio files
- Before generating new audio, check if it already exists
- If audio exists, serve the cached version
- If not, generate it once and save permanently
- Ensure audio files are organized and easily retrievable

## Step 2: Cache AI-Generated Content

**Goal:** Store formatted questions and Arabic explanations permanently

**Instructions:**
- Extend the database to store processed question content and explanations
- Before calling AI services, check if processed content already exists
- If cached content exists, use it directly
- If not, process once and store the results
- Consider adding capability to regenerate content if needed

## Step 3: Optimize Question Types

**Goal:** Only generate audio for listening comprehension questions

**Instructions:**
- Implement logic to identify question types based on their position in the test
- Skip audio generation entirely for reading and grammar questions
- Adjust the user interface to show audio controls only when relevant
- Ensure the system handles questions without audio gracefully

**General Benefits:**
- Dramatic reduction in API costs
- Much faster response times for users
- More reliable service (less dependent on external APIs)
- Better scalability as user base grows
